# photo gallery app
This a photo gallery or image search project using create-react-app.
Here I use axios to fetch the images from unsplash site and show the result in my page, according the image individual size.
It has both light & dark mode in feature and it store your mode setting in local storage, so you can reach same mode once after close an another tab or new tab.
